# SHACL UI

This repository implements the following as a SHACL _User-Interface_ processor:
- SHACL shape extraction
- SHACL Constraint Component extraction
- SHACL NodeShape visitor
- Map of SHACL parameters to Constraint Components
- DASH widget score calculator and widget extraction
- Vue component implementation of base RDF widgets, DASH widgets, and custom widgets

This is still a work-in-progress. A storybook demo of the SHACL UI processor will be available on GitHub Pages soon.
